    <h2>Description:</h2>
    
    <p>Apple crumble is a British pudding similar to the apple crisp that originated during World War II food rationing. The crumble topping is made of butter, flour, and brown sugar rolled together so that it resembles breadcrumbs.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <h3>For the Crust & Filling</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>1 recipe basic pie dough</li>
        <li>3 lb. assorted sweet-tart apples (such as Granny Smith or Honeycrisp) cored, peeled, and sliced ½” thick</li>
        <li>2 tbsp. freshly squeezed lemon juice</li>
        <li>1/2 c. packed brown sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 c. plus 2 tsp. all-purpose flour, plus more for rolling</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp. freshly grated nutmeg (optional)</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp. kosher salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>For the Crumble Topping</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>1 1/3 c. all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>3/4 c. packed brown sugar</li>
        <li>1/3 c. finely chopped walnuts</li>
        <li>1 tsp. kosher salt</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp. ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp. ground allspice (optional)</li>
        <li>1/2 c. melted butter</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 425º with a baking sheet on the middle rack.</li>
        <li>On a lightly floured surface, roll out dough into a 12” circle. Drape over a 9" pie dish and gently press to fit (don’t stretch). Trim edge to a 1” overhang, then tuck dough under itself and crimp edges. Refrigerate 40 minutes or freeze 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, combine apples, lemon juice, sugar, flour, cinnamon, nutmeg if using, and salt in a large bowl and toss to combine.</li>
        <li>Transfer apples to chilled crust. Transfer pie to preheated baking sheet and bake 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, make crumble topping: in a medium bowl, whisk together flour, sugar, walnuts, salt, cinnamon, and allspice if using. Stir in butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs.</li>
        <li>After pie has baked for 20 minutes, remove from oven and top with crumble mixture. Reduce heat to 375º, return to oven, and bake until top and crust are golden, 45 to 55 minutes more. (If crust begins to look dark, cover with foil.)</li>
        <li>Let cool to room temperature, at least 3 hours, before slicing and serving.</li>
    </ol>
